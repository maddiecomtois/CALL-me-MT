  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>You are invited to participate in this study on machine translation and language learning, 
    which aims to test if quick and easy access to translations enhances the reader’s experience.  
    When reading in a foreign language, learners usually have to stop in the middle of a sentence 
    to look up a word or phrase that they do not know.  This lack of vocabulary and start-stop process 
    disrupts the ability to read fluently in a foreign language, which can be frustrating to the reader.  
    Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) can help foreign language learners in providing technology 
    to enhance their learning experience.</p>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>You are asked to spend at least five minutes reading public domain text in a foreign language of your 
    choice on a web application, looking up words or phrases that are unfamiliar to you. After spending as 
    much time as you like reading and translating the text, we ask you to fill out an anonymous survey about your experience.  
    This survey should take no more than 15 minutes and is entirely anonymous.  When you come across a word or phrase that you do not know during your 
    reading, you can click on the word or phrase to display a translation.  </p>
    
    <p> How to use the platform: </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li> Select the language you are learning from the menu on the left side of the screen </li>
      <li> Select a story from the available options provided in the submenu </li>
      <li> Read as much of the story as you wish to improve your foreing langauge reading skills</li>
      <li> If you come across a word or phrase you do not know, highlight the text with your mouse. A translation will be displayed above the text
      when the mouse is released </li>
      <li> Happy reading! </li>
    </ol>
